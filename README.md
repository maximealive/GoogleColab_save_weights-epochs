# Google Colaboratory save weights and epochs

Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb.



In case of problems here are some suggestions:
- Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> GPU
- run '!kill -9 -1'
- delete files from drive and reload the page to be sure that the folder is empty (repeat it several times)
- reload Google Colaboratory page
