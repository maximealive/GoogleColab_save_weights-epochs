# Google Colaboratory save weights and epochs (resuming a training process)

When training a model, it could be necessary save checkpoints of that modelâ€™s state so we could recover an interrupted training process and restart it from where it left off. 

**IMPORTANT**


Change default hardware enabling GPU:
_Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> GPU_


In case of problems here are some suggestions:
- run `!kill -9 -1`
- delete files from drive and reload the page to be sure that the folder is empty (repeat it several times)
- reload Google Colaboratory page
